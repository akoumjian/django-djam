Testing
=======

All tests for Djam should be unit tests. We don't use doctests. To run the tests, make sure you have tox_ installed (with ``pip install tox``). Then all you have to do is go to the root of the repository and run ``tox``.

Pull requests that do not have a passing test suite will not be accepted. Pull requests that do not include tests will also not be accepted.
