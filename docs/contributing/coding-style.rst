Coding style
============

Please follow these coding standards when writing code for Djam.

Python style
------------

* Unless otherwise specified, follow `PEP 8`_. Since we're a new
  project, there shouldn't be any cases (apart from those outlined
  here) where you need to instead conform to surrounding code.
* Use four spaces for indentation.
* In docstrings, use "action words". For example, "Calculates the number of apples" rather than "Calculate the number of apples".
* Empty lines should not contain indentation.
