django-djam
===========

Djam is a third-party admin started at DjangoCon 2012 with the following goals:

* Provide basic CRUD functionality similar to the current admin.
* Make it easy to add new workflows (or similar custom admin sections).
* Provide documentation on how to do said customization.
* Use the latest front-end tools and design patterns.

The name is alliterative; the beginning of Djam is pronounced the same as the beginning of Django.
